# Wall-Following-Robot-Car-PID-Controlled-
A PID-controlled Wall-Following Robot Car built using Arduino IDE. Maintains a fixed distance from the wall using real-time sensor feedback and precise PID tuning. Developed as part of my second-year studies to explore embedded systems, control, and robotics.
