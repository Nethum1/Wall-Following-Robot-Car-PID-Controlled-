I designed and developed a prototype Wall-Following Robot Car using 'Arduino IDE' and 'PID control'. The robot continuously maintains a set distance from the wall, adjusting its movement in real time through precise PID tuning. 

🔹 Key Features:

✅ Prototype autonomous vehicle with real-time wall-following capability 

✅ Implemented 'PID control' for smooth and accurate navigation 

✅ Programmed in 'Arduino IDE' with real-time sensor feedback 

✅ Maintains a 'consistent distance' from the wall for optimal movement 

✅ Hands-on experience in 'embedded systems and robotics' 

This project enhanced my understanding of 'control systems, sensor integration, and embedded programming'. Excited to explore more in 'robotics and automation'! 🚀

Here's a polished and professional GitHub project description based on your original content, tailored for your GitHub repository:

🚗 Wall-Following Robot Car (PID-Controlled)
As part of my second-year academic journey, I developed a Wall-Following Robot Car prototype using Arduino IDE and PID control algorithms. This autonomous robot is designed to maintain a fixed distance from a wall, adjusting its trajectory in real time based on sensor feedback and PID tuning.

🔧 Project Highlights:
🧭 Autonomous Wall-Following: Continuously detects and follows walls while maintaining a consistent distance.

🎯 PID Control Implementation: Ensures smooth, stable, and accurate movement.

💻 Arduino IDE Programming: Coded using Arduino with real-time sensor data processing.

🤖 Embedded Systems Application: Integrated sensors and control logic in a compact embedded platform.

📐 Precision Navigation: Effectively responds to environmental changes and obstacles.

🔍 What I Learned:
This project deepened my practical knowledge in:

* Control systems and PID tuning

* Sensor integration and real-time data handling

* Embedded systems development and robotics design

I'm excited to build on this foundation as I continue exploring robotics, automation, and intelligent systems.
